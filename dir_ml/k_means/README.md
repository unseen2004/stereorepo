# K-Means Clustering

K-Means clustering implementation with visualizations of cluster assignments and centroids.

---

## Overview

Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning. Groups data points into K clusters based on feature similarity and visualizes the results.

---

## Requirements

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## Running

Execute the clustering script:
```bash
python k_means.py
```

---

## Features

- K-Means clustering algorithm
- Configurable number of clusters
- Visualization of cluster assignments
- Centroid position visualization
- Iterative optimization to convergence

---

## Outputs

- `assignment_k10.png` - Cluster assignments for K=10
- `centroids_k10.png` - Centroid positions for K=10
