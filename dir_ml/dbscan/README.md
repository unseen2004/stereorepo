# DBSCAN Clustering

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm applied to MNIST/EMNIST datasets.

---

## Overview

Implementation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm for grouping similar handwritten digits from the MNIST/EMNIST datasets. DBSCAN identifies clusters based on density and can detect outliers.

---

## Requirements

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## Running

Execute the clustering script:
```bash
python dbscan.py
```

---

## Features

- Density-based clustering
- Automatic cluster detection
- Noise/outlier identification
- Visualization of clustering results
- Applied to handwritten digit datasets
